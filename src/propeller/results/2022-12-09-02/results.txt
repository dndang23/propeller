Testing conducted: Compared lexicase and epsilon-lexicase selection with an increase of standard deviation in mutation method
from 0.01 to 0.2

Epsilon-lexicase selection seems to be on par with lexicase when running probabilistic plushy genomes

Implement epsilon-lexicse selection to run more efficiently and perform the same comparison of
lexicase selection v. epsilon-lexicsae selection using probabilistic plushy genomes
