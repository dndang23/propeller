Testing conducted: Compared Propeller performance using regular Plushy versus Probabilistic Plushy with epsilon-lexicase on two new symbolic regression problems

Results: Surprisingly, Propeller seemed to improve performance using Probabilistic Plushies than with regular Plushy genomes on the symbolic
regression problem that had the target function (1 + x^3)^3 + 1

Need to find more symbolic regression problems that Propeller struggle with when using regular Plushies
