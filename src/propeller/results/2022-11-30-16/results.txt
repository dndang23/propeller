Testing conducted: default plushy and probabilistic plushy with 30% UMAD and 70% adjusted probability mutation

It seems that increasing percentage of UMAD increased the success rate and lowered the average number of generations for
sucess.

Plan to test with same percentages with tournament selection and increasing UMAD to 50% and decreasing adjusted probability
mutation to 50%
