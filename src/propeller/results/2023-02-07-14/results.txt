Testing conducted: Compared Propeller performance using regular Plushy versus Probabilistic Plushy with epsilon-lexicase with equal computational resources

Results:    Probabilistic Plushy helped Propeller perform better on symbolic regression 4. Regular Plushies performed better on all the other problems.

Future work: Run the same experiment with the same symbolic regression problems increasing the standard deviation
