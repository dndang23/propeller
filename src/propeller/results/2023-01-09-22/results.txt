Testing conducted: Compared Propeller performance using regular Plushy versus Probabilistic Plushy with epsilon-lexicase on three symbolic regression problems

Results: Propeller performed better with regular Plushy than when using Probabilistic Plushy

Future Work: Need to find symbolic regression problems that Propeller struggle with when using regular Plushies
