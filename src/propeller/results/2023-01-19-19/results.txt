Testing conducted: Compared Propeller performance using regular Plushy versus Probabilistic Plushy with epsilon-lexicase on new symbolic regression problems

Results: Inconclusive as jobs had to be canceled due to incorrect use of the GPU cluster

Future work: Need to find more symbolic regression problems that Propeller struggle with when using regular Plushies and run jobs on the CPU cluster
