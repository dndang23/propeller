Testing conducted: Compared lexicase and tournament selection with an increase of standard deviation in mutation method
from 0.01 to 0.2

Both versions outputted a solution in a fewer number of generations with lexicase having a higher success rate than
tournament for all three symbolic regression problems.

Implemented epsilon-lexicase selection and now plan to test it against lexicase selection
