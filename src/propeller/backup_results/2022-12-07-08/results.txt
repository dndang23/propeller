Testing conducted: Compared lexicase and tournament selection with an increase of standard deviation in mutation method
from 0.01 to 0.2

Both versions outputted a solution in a fewer number of generations with lexicase having a higher success rate than
tournament for all three symbolic regression problems.

Plan to implement epsilon-lexicase selection and test with it
For now I will conduct additional runs on lexicase and tournament selection with standard deviation of 0.2
